# Babel 2.0, welcome Broid

"The world is more and more connected." We chat, photograph, and can order everything we want on the internet.

This is possible through millions and millions of lines of code written every day. The internet is not truly connected in a simple way, where one platform has difficulty or is even impossible to speak to another, in a sense creating __a modern day Babel tower__. The task has therefore has become difficult for developers wanting to make this world simpler, such as wishing to control Uber via SMS, or JustEat with their voice.

Allowing developers to focus only on the problems they want to solve and not wasting time learning new documentation would benifit everyone. And this is why [Broid](www.broid.ai) has been born!

[Broid](www.broid.ai) is a synonym of the word _braid_. Enabling developers to _braid_ communications between different platforms, different services and data schemas.

[Broid](www.broid.ai) is [an open source project](https://github.com/broidhq/feedhack), which means free use. Like any open source project, you are free to bring your ideas, your integrations and especially your criticisms!
